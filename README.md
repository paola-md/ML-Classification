# First ML Project

### Methodology

To accomplish our task, our methodology was:
- Data cleaning:
    - We cleaned the data, correcting incongruencies and ordering the features
- Classifiers tryout
    - We tried several classificators side by side and concluded the Random Forest Classifiers was the best one
- Further RFC Analysis
    - We dove into the way the Random Forest Classifiers works, further analizing what mistakes it made and what features had the most weight in its classification
- Feature Engineering
    - We engineered a couple of features so as to try to improve its performance, and tried different combinations of the most important features to see what result it would have on the classification
